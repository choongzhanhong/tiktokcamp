# Getting Started with React Hangman App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setting Up:

1. Clone the repository to your local drive.
2. In the project directory, install the following dependencies:
    
    ### `npm install react-modal random-words react-toggle-button react-router-dom@6`

3. After installation is complete, you can run: 
    
    ### `npm start`

    This runs the app in the development mode.\
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

    The page will reload when you make changes.\
    You may also see any lint errors in the console.

Alternatively, you can use our application deployed through Vercel.
