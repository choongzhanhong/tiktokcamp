# Getting Started with React Hangman App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setting up a local copy of the project:

1. Clone the repository at https://github.com/tiktok-youths-16/tiktokcamp.git to your local drive.
2. In the project directory, install the following dependencies:
    
    ### `npm install react-modal random-words react-toggle-button react-router-dom@6`

3. After installation is complete, you can run: 
    
    ### `npm start`

    This runs the app in the development mode.\
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

    The page will reload when you make changes.\
    You may also see any lint errors in the console.
